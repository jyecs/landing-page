A bit of a refresher of css and flex for myself, and I don't think it exactly matches.
I'm sure that I was supposed to add actual images and I may do so if I come back and check up on things again.
I think that overal my CSS was quite bad, especially in the beginning, but I want to learn more and might clean things up a bit later on.
I'm sure that there are way better ways / more effecient ways to do so.
